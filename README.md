# Exercise

Exercise has long been shown to provide many health benefits. Studies have shown a link between genetics and exercise, and how people respond to exercise for weight loss and other health benefits.

## Strength training

Strength training can be described as exercises that incorporate the use of opposing forces to build muscle. In a small study of young adult men, those with the C/G or C/C genotypes at rs7566605 were more likely to experience increased fat volume after participating in 12 weeks of resistance training, and thus strength training was "less beneficial". This association has not been identified in women.

## Aerobic capacity (VO2max)

Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is widely used as the best measure of an individual's cardiorespiratory fitness. VO2max is defined as the maximum volume of oxygen per unit time that an individual uses at maximum exertion. The baseline VO2max level can vary depending on age, gender, past medical history, current health and level of physical activity. However, anyone can increase their fitness and VO2max by endurance training. Elite athletes in endurance sports, such as cross-country skiing and long-distance running, have a higher VO2max than elite athletes in power sports, such as wrestling and weightlifting.

The rs8192678 SNP in the PPARGC1A gene, which is a key regulator of energy metabolism, was associated with baseline VO2max (L/min) in a study of 303 Spanish and British men. The C/C and C/T genotypes of rs8192678 were associated with "normal" VO2max, whereas the T/T genotype was associated with a "decreased" VO2max. This association has not been studied in women. Please remember that you can always increase your VO2max and fitness by endurance training, even if you start with a decreased aerobic capacity.

## Muscle power

Do you have a genetic variant that is found in nearly all sprinters qualified for top-level competitions like the Olympic Games? The so-called "sprinter gene" refers to the functional version of the ACTN3 gene, which contains information for making a protein found in fast-twitch muscle fibers. The protein and the fast-twitch muscle fibers are important in generating explosive bursts of force. This is why the functional version of ACTN3 is also seen with high frequencies in other elite power-oriented athletes, such as weightlifters.

About 80% of people have at least one functional copy of the ACTN3 gene, which can lead to enhanced muscle power. However, having functional ACTN3 is only one of a myriad of genetic and non-genetic factors that contribute to the success of elite athletes. The remaining 20% of people, who do not have a functional copy of ACTN3, may have less muscle power and are less likely to be world-class sprinters or weightlifters, but their chance to excel may not be affected in sports that require other types of body performance, such as endurance and nimbleness.

## Achilles tendinopathy

The Achilles tendon connects your calf muscles to your heel bone. Tendinopathy describes either the inflammation or tiny tears to the tendon. People who play sports and runners who place stress on the Achilles tendon have the greatest likelihood of tendinopathy. If you have a C/C genotype you may be more "injury-prone," while other genotypes have a "normal" likelihood of developing Achilles tendinopathy. In a small study, people with the C/C genotype at rs679620 (MMP3) had 2.5 times more chance of developing Achilles tendinopathy compared to other genotypes.

## Weight loss response to exercise

Exercise is a large part of many weight loss plans, as it is a crucial tool for weight control for everyone. The A allele has been shown to be associated with a tendency to be overweight, and exercise is strongly recommended for you. While the G/G genotype translates to one less risk factor for being overweight. However, this should not be taken as one less reason to exercise, because being physically active is beneficial to all people, regardless of genetic makeup. The A allele in the genetic marker rs1121890 of the FTO gene has been shown to be associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and waistline. However, a large study showed that people who have this variant could reduce their propensity to increased BMI by being physically active.

## Blood pressure response to exercise

High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common health issue. It has been estimated that a majority of people will have hypertension at some time in their lives. A genetic variant in the EDN1 gene has been shown to increase the likelihood of hypertension in people who were low in cardiorespiratory fitness, which refers to the ability of the heart and lungs to provide muscles with oxygen for physical activity. This genetic variant did not show an effect in people who were high in cardiorespiratory fitness. If you have this variant, you may need to exercise to reduce your chances of hypertension. If you do not have the variant, exercise is still the right decision to manage other risk factors for high blood pressure you may have.

## HDL cholesterol response to exercise

One of the health benefits of exercise can be the improvement of your cholesterol. HDL cholesterol is known as the good cholesterol, and having more HDL is beneficial. Most people can improve their HDL levels by exercising. In the Heritage Family Study, people with the T/C and C/C genotypes were more likely to have an "enhanced benefit" in their HDL levels by exercising. People with "normal benefit" may also increase their HDL levels by exercising, but may not experience an enhanced effect.

## Loss of body fat response to exercise

Many people exercise to lose body fat. If you have a specific genotype in the gene LPL, you may have an "enhanced benefit" from exercise to lose body fat. If you have the "normal benefit" genotype, you will still experience fat reduction if you exercise, but it might take more effort. The study was based on women who participated in a 20-week endurance training program. This association has not been identified in men.

## Insulin sensitivity response to exercise

Insulin sensitivity is a good thing. Insulin in your body helps control your response to glucose, commonly known as sugar. Having an increased insulin sensitivity means that the body has a better ability to process sugar. The opposite of insulin sensitivity is called insulin resistance, which is linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most people have a beneficial response to exercise, resulting in increased insulin sensitivity. According to a study, people with C/C or C/T genotypes, at a marker in the LIPC gene, showed an "enhanced benefit," compared to those with a T/T genotype. Although people with T/T genotypes are likely to gain "less benefit" in insulin sensitivity from exercise training, exercise remains important in many other aspects of their health.

## Scientific Strength Rating System

The genetic markers and studies selected in this genome app represent the best and most recent genetic research in diet, nutrition, exercise and weight-related health conditions. Some research can be described as stronger than others based on the size of the population studied and whether the outcome has been replicated. Due to the current state of scientific research on the genetics of diet, exercise and nutrition, most of the studies referenced in these results are based on individuals of Caucasian ethnicity. While we all have the same genes, there are genetic and non-genetic factors in different ethnicities that might yield different outcomes for non-Caucasian populations.

Strength of Study:
 * 1/4 : Results in this category should be considered extremely preliminary.
 * 2/4 : Small study of less than 400 people in some cases, with other small replicated studies. Results in this category are preliminary, but pass our criteria for statistical significance.
 * 3/4 : Results derived from a moderately-sized study of at least 400 people, with or without a replication study.
 * 4/4 : Results derived from a large study of approximately 2,000 or more people, with at least one additional study showing the same results (replication study).
